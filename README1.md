### Day 1: October 27, 2018 
**Today's Focus**: Hello World

**Details**:

  **Task**: 
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

You've got this!

Note: The instructions are Java-based, but we support submissions in many popular languages. You can switch languages using the drop-down menu above your editor, and the  variable may be written differently depending on the best-practice conventions of your submission language.

**Input Format**:

A single line of text denoting  (the variable whose contents must be printed).

**Output Format**:

Print Hello, World. on the first line, and the contents of  on the second line.

**Sample Input**:

Welcome to 30 Days of Code!
Sample Output

Hello, World. 
Welcome to 30 Days of Code!
Explanation

On the first line, we print the string literal Hello, World.. On the second line, we print the contents of the  variable which, for this sample case, happens to be Welcome to 30 Days of Code!. If you do not print the variable's contents to stdout, you will not pass the hidden test case.

### Day 2: October 28, 2018
**Today's Focus**: Data Type 

**Details**:

 *Task*-->

 - Complete the code in the editor below. The variables , , and  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
 Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
 Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
 Use the  operator to perform the following operations: 
 Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
  Note: If you are using a language that doesn't support using  for string concatenation (e.g.: C), you can just print one variable immediately following the other on the same line. The string provided in your editor must be printed first, immediately followed by the string you read as input.
- Sample Input

  12                                                                               
  4.0
  is the best place to learn and practice coding!
- Sample Output

 16
 8.0
 HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!
- Explanation

When we sum the integers  and , we get the integer . 
When we sum the floating-point numbers  and , we get . 
When we concatenate HackerRank with is the best place to learn and practice coding!, we get HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!
